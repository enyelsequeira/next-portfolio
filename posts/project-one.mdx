summary: 'Iterative.ai, a data science and machine learning version control platform, came to us wanting a new static landing page built with Gatsby. With two other developers we were able to develop and ship this site in about 3 weeks. We organized tasks on Trello and collaborated via Github to pull all the components together. We decided to use Styled Components as this design framework pairs nicely with Gatsby.',
