# Introduction

 This project was built during a live coding event hosted by Practicum by Yandex, where they asked me how to build a website/blog using the <span> JAM </span> stack. 
 
The project was actually built using Gatsby and Contentful, but after finishing the coding event, I thought the code could be better written for further improvements in the future, after finishing I decided to re do the code-base using another stack.

After finishing,  the stack that I decided to use was NextJS as it is a very popular react framework, but also very easy to use and create production like applications. With NextJS I've also decided to use TypeScript, because I started learning a few weeks ago and wanted to build a site with it to practice.

The project itself took me about 2 days to finish. Most of the data that is being render for information is coming from <span>Contentful</span> and the blog posts are using <span>MDX</span>. This is something that in the future I plan on changing and only using one source to fetch the data from. 

# Challenges


# Improvements that could be made and are in the process
- It could render information from only one source, instead of having two different sources.
- The app could have a functionality to create a user and each user could have its own dashboard to save posts to read later
- The app could have a filter by categories
- The app could recommend most viewed blog post of the week as well as could have a function to like or dislike the post
- The app could have a section after each post to create a suggestion box, in order to change something in the post or add more up to date a correct information
