# introduction

This a full stack project that was built during my bootcamp with Practicum by Yandex. 
 
This project took about 3 weeks to finishing both front-end part and the back-end, for the front-end it uses<span> React </span> and <span> BEM</span>, to style components accordingly. This app combines two different <span>API's'</span> one that is the newsApi, and the other one is my own api.

For my own <span>API</span>, I am using NodeJS and hosting with <span>AWS</span>, I am using express to handle routes as well as other middleware for the app's logic, such as routing and validation.


# functionalities 
- It allows the user to sign-up, and sign-m for this it use my own <span>API</span> 
- Back-end Validation to have unique values for username and for password to have the minimum characters
- Front-end Validation for when the user sign in, it must submit the correct value and allow the user to protected routes
- It allows the user to search for news, if no keyword is found or entered the button will be disabled
- It allows the user to save the news to read later, if it is duplicate it will not be saved
- It allows the user to go protected route like a personal dashboard where the news are saved 
- User can delete the news from the dashboard

# challenges
- Not having worked with <span>TypeScript</span> in the past, it made it difficult to understand some concepts that I wanted to apply in the code.
- Not being a designer, I have always struggled with finding the right colors and the layout components
- Using <span> Contenful </span> creating the queries was a bit difficult to do, but was able to do, it does need refactoring to make it better using the DRY method.
- Adding features such as leaving comments and likes will be difficult as I would need a way to store the data  


# improvements that could be made and are in the process
- Better codebase, I think the readability of the code is messy as of now, due to standards I had to follow.
- Logic needs to improved and separated to follow up to date standards
- Better UI design, as of now the design is too plain
- Backend-end code could be improved by using a different database such as PSQL and using <span>typeORM</span> 
- Front-end could be done with TypeScript and probably NextJS or Gatsby
