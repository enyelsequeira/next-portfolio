# introduction

 This project was built during a live coding event hosted by Practicum by Yandex, where they asked me how to build a website/blog using the <span> JAM </span> stack. 
 
The project was actually built using <span> Gatsby </span> and <span> Contentful </span> , but after finishing the coding event, I thought the code could be better written for further improvements in the future, after finishing I decided to re do the code-base using another stack.

After finishing, the stack that I decided to use was <span> NextJS </span> as it is a very popular react framework, but also very easy to use and create production like applications. With NextJS I've also decided to use <span> TypeScript </span>, because I started learning a few weeks ago and wanted to build a site with it to practice.

The project itself took me about 2 days to finish. Most of the data that is being render for information is coming from <span> Contentful</span> and the blog posts are using <span>MDX</span>. This is something that in the future I plan on changing and only using one source to fetch the data from. 

# challenges
- Not having worked with <span>TypeScript</span> in the past, it made it difficult to understand some concepts that I wanted to apply in the code.
- Not being a designer, I have always struggled with finding the right colors and the layout components
- Using <span> Contenful </span> creating the queries was a bit difficult to do, but was able to do, it does need refactoring to make it better using the DRY method.
- Adding features such as leaving comments and likes will be difficult as I would need a way to store the data  


# improvements that could be made and are in the process
- It could render information from only one source, instead of having two different sources.
- The app could have a functionality to create a user and each user could have its own dashboard to save posts to read later
- The app could have a filter by categories
- The app could recommend most viewed blog post of the week as well as could have a function to like or dislike the post
- The app could have a section after each post to create a suggestion box, in order to change something in the post or add more up to date a correct information
